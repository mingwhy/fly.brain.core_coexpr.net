## phylostratigraphy

The goal of phylostratigraphy is to infer the evolutionary origin of each gene in an organism. This is done by searching for homologs within increasingly broad clades. The deepest clade that contains a homolog of the protein(s) encoded by a gene is that geneâ€™s phylostratum.

I used **TableS1.xlsx** from this publication

- 2017 [No Evidence for Phylostratigraphic Bias Impacting Inferences on Patterns of Gene Emergence and Evolution](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/34/4/843/2897203)

go get fly gene ages.
